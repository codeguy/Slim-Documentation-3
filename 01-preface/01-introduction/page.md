## Preface

Welcome to the Slim Framework, a PHP micro framework designed to help you quickly build websites and APIs.
The best way to learn the Slim Framework is this documentation. If you are in a hurry,
go straight to the "Quickstart" section. Otherwise, we recommend you first read the "Getting Started"
section from beginning to end. The "Getting Started" section will demonstrate:

* Installation
* Configuration
* Core concepts
* HTTP requests and inputs
* HTTP responses and views
* Error handling

After you read the "Getting Started" section, proceed to the "Learn More" section to read
about more advanced Slim Framework features.

## Philosophy

The Slim Framework's core philosophy is and always will be "simplicity instead of complexity." This
philosophy is reflected in Slim's architectural design, feature set, and source code.
